[patch.crates-io]
# We require the use of certain constructs which unfortunately were not
# included in the latest released version of diesel (1.4.3).  We are hopeful
# that in a later version (presumably 1.4.4), they will be included, however
# the minimum rustc version required will surely be higher then -- minimally,
# at 1.37.  The patch tables below reference a version of diesel and related
# utility macros that rust-sharkspotter can safely use until we are able to move
# to an officially released version of diesel which hopefully has the structures
# and macros that we rely on.  In summary, there are two things that need to
# happen in the future to move to the next diesel release.  First, we need to
# upgrade rustc to something more current (ideally rustc 1.40) and then we need
# to confirm whether or not the new release of diesel will contain the
# constructs needed to successfully build rust-sharkspotter.  If it does not,
# then we will have to consider avenues for eliminating their use from within
# the rust-sharkspotter code.  Finally, dependencies listed in the patch section
# of this project are transitive, so they should also be used when builing any
# depedencies that also rely on diesel (which is a good thing).
